This version of SpatGRIS doesn't keep the Hybrid information in the Speaker Setup anymore. Hybrid mode is kept only in the Projects. If you saved a Speaker Setup made with a SpatGRIS version prior to 3.1.8, please save your actual project with the Hybrid information before upgrading to this version.
