# ServerGRIS
ServerGRIS is developed by the Groupe de recherche en immersion spatiale (GRIS) at Université de Montréal. The software is dedicated to sound spatialization in 2D (plane mode, X and Y axis) and 3D (with vertical mode, Z axis). It includes a Speaker Setup design page and the movements are controled by an external OSC source, namely SpatGRIS, a plugin for Audio Unit and VST DAWs. 
The Server works on Jack and includes 256 inputs and outputs with as many VU-meters as needed.
The Server has a 3D and 2D view window and offers the possibility of viewing the sound activity in the 3D window.
The software is in its development phase and updates are published on a regular basis.
